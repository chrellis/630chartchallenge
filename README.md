Day 3: Pictogram. 24 emotions from 5pm Dec 8 to 5pm Dec 9, one for each hour in a day

Used pywaffle and Dakota Chang's first pictogram code for guidance/help. 

Day 4: Historical. This visualization is a modern recreation of one of William Playfair's line graphs from the 18th century. I've included the original below.

Day 5:  Magical. I made a pictogram to represent Magic Johnson's Height. I hope you enjoy!

Day 6: Slopes. Using a bar graph, I compared prices for a single adult to ski at 4 ski resorts (where they would ski on slopes) from 1/6 to 1/7

* Used this [website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bar-plot-in-matplotlib/) for bar graph help in python

Day 7: Experimental. I'm representing a polar rose with a 3d plt stem plot. I just wanted to use it and see how it worked.

I used the example on the matplotlib website as a template and messed around with data values and equations until I got a cool design. I have no idea what this is or what it means, but it's gorgeous.
